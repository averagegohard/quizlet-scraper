	-Na+ channels open and Na+ flows into the cell because there's more Na+ outside than inside
	-the membrane depolarizes

Step 4

	-if the depolarization reaches a critical level (called the threshold), then an action potential will definitely happen
	-voltage-gated Na+ channels open at threshold and gNa increases briefly
	-the inside of the neuron becomes positive relative to the outside

Step 5
	Falling Phase
	-voltage-gated sodium channels close (inactivate) after 1 millisecond of being open
	-they cannot open again until the membrane potential reaches the threshold of -40 mV
	-voltage-gated K+ channels open 1 millisecond after depolarization
	-gK increases and K+ ions flow out of the neuron

Step 6
	Undershoot
	-K+ flows out of the neuron until the inside becomes more negative than resting potential
	-voltage-gated K+ channels close and the neuron reaches normal resting membrane potential again

Step 2
	the receptor proteins activate G-proteins, which move along the inside of the postsynaptic cell

Step 3
	the activated G-proteins activate effector proteins

Step 4a
	the effector protein could be a G-protein-gated ion channel

Step 4b
	the effector protein could be an enzyme that synthesizes second messengers

Step 5
	the second messengers activate additional enzymes that regulate ion channel function and alter cell metabolism

Autoreceptors
	-receptors on the membrane of the presynaptic cell
	-usually G-protein-coupled receptors
	-they're usually activated by the neurotransmitter that was released to the postsynaptic cell
	-usually, their activation inhibits neurotransmitter production and release to control the amount of neurotransmitters in the cleft

Neurotransmitter Recovery
	-the neurotransmitters need to be cleared from the cleft so another round of synaptic transmission can occur
	-sometimes, the neurotransmitters will diffuse through the extracellular fluid and away from the cleft
	-otherwise, transporter proteins can facilitate the reuptake of the neurotransmitters into the presynaptic cell
	-the neurotransmitters are then reloaded into vesicles or broken down for recycling

Neurotransmitter Degradation
	-another way to remove neurotransmitters from the cleft
	-an enzyme cleaves the ACh molecules and renders them inactive
	-this is how ACh is removed from the cleft of the neuromuscular junction
	-too much exposure of the receptors to ACh leads to desensitization and the inability for neuromuscular transmission to occur

Temporal Summation
	adding together of EPSPs generated at the same synapse if they occur within a few milliseconds of each other

Shunting Inhibition
	-a type of inhibition
	-when synaptic transmission prevents the current from flowing through the soma to the axon hillock
	-Cl- ions flow into the cell and the membrane potential approaches ECl-, which is the resting potential (-65 mV)

Modulation
	-sometimes synapses contain G-protein coupled neurotransmitter receptors that are not associated with an ion channel
	-these receptors do not directly initiate EPSPs or IPSPs
	-they modify the effectiveness of EPSPs
	-ex: norepinephrine beta receptor



NOREPINEPHRINE BETA RECEPTOR STEPS
	...

Step 1
	when norepinephrine binds to the beta receptor, it activates a G-protein, which activates enzyme adenylyl cyclase

Step 2
	Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger

Step 3
	cAMP stimulates another enzyme called protein kinase

Step 4
	-protein kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of a potassium channel, causing it to close
	-this makes the neuron more excitable because the "leaks" in the dendrite and increases the likelihood that the EPSP will reach the axon

	-class of drugs derived from opium poppy
	-includes heroine and morphine
	-found that these opiates would bind to the neurotransmitter receptors and act as agonists
	-these are not neurotransmitters, however, those were discovered to be enkephalins (they bind to the same receptors)

Opioids
	-opiate-like chemicals that are both natural and synthetic
	-effects include pain relief, euphoria, depressed breathing, etc

Ligands
	-molecules that bind to specific sites on a receptor
	-can be either antagonists, agonists, or neurotransmitters

Ligand-Binding Method
	-using radioactively and non radioactively labeled ligands to study receptors
	-these ligands have helped isolate neurotransmitter receptors and determine their chemical structure

Dale's Principle
	-a neuron only has one neurotransmitter
	-this is true of most neurons, except those containing peptide neurotransmitters
	-those neurons release a peptide and then either an amine or amino acid

Co-transmitters
	when two or more neurotransmitters are released from the same terminal



TYPES OF NEURONS
	...

1. Cholinergic Neurons
	-includes all motor neurons in spinal cord and brain stem
	-synthesize and release acetylcholine (ACh) as the neurotransmitter and an ACh degradative enzyme
	-neuromuscular junction
	-all uniquely contain enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which can also be used to identify these neurons

Acetylcholine Synthesis
	-enzyme called choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) synthesizes ACh in the axon terminal
	-ChAT transfers an acetyl group to acetyl CoA to choline
	-choline is found in the extracellular fluid in low concentrations
	-transport of choline into the neuron = rate limiting step because the concentration of choline determines how much acetylcholine is made

AChE
	-acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme synthesized by cholinergic neurons
	-secreted into cleft
	-degrades ACh into choline and acetic acid
	-the choline is taken up by the presynaptic cell for more ACh synthesis

2. Catecholaminergic Neurons
	-found in the region of the nervous system involved in regulation of movement, mood, attention, and visceral function
	-synthesize and release catecholamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (adrenaline)
	-all contain enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)

Dopamine Synthesis
	-enzyme tyrosine hydroxlase (TH) catalyzes the synthesis
	-tyrosine is converted into dopa
	-TH activity is the rate limiting step
	-enzyme dopa decarboxylase converts Dopa into the neurotransmitter dopamine

Parkinson's Disease
	-when dopaminergic neurons in the brain slowly degenerate
	-patients are given dopa, which leads to an increase dopamine synthesis in surviving neurons

Norepinephrine Synthesis
	-these neurons also contain TH, enzyme dopa decarboxylase, and enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase
	-dopamine beta-hydroxylase converts the dopamine that is synthesized into norepinephrine once it is loaded into the synaptic vesicles

Epinephrine (Adrenaline) Synthesis
	-enzyme phentolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) converts norepinephrine into to epinephrine
	-the norepinephrine must first be released from the synaptic vesicles to be converted in the cytosol
	-it is transported to the vesicles again for release
	-epinephrine also acts as a hormone when it is released by the adrenal gland into the bloodstream

Catecholamine Reuptake
	-there is no enzyme that can quickly degrade these neurotransmitters when the accumulate in the cleft
	-Na+-dependent transporters take the neurotransmitters back into the presynaptic cell
	-drugs like amphetamine and cocaine block the reuptake and prolong the actions of the neurotransmitters
	-the neurotransmitters can be reloaded into the synaptic vesicles for reuse or are destroyed by enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO)

3. Serotonergic Neurons
	-in regions of the brain that regulate mood, emotional behavior, and sleep
	-contain the neurotransmitter serotonin

Serotonin (5-HT) Synthesis
	-tryptophan is converted into 5-hyroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase
	-5-HTP is converted to 5-HT (serotonin) by enzyme 5-HTP decarboxylase

Serotonin Reuptake
	-a transporter takes the serotonin back into the presynaptic cell
	-antidepressant and antianxiety drugs inhibit serotonin reuptake
	-the neurotransmitter can be recycled and reloaded into vesicles or degraded by MAO

4. Amino Acidergic Neurons
	-found in most CNS synapses
	-use neurotransmitters glutamate, glycine, and GABA

Glutamate and Glycine Synthesis
	-synthesized from glucose and other precursors in all cells (they are amino acids)
	-these neurons just make more of these 2 amino acids
	-the transporter proteins also fill synaptic vesicles in neurons containing these neurotransmitters until the concentration is 50 mM

GABA Synthesis
	-synthesized in only neurons that use it as a neurotransmitter
	-enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) converts glutamate into GABA
	-GABAergic neurons are a source of synaptic inhibition

Amino Acid and GABA Reuptake
	-presynaptic terminals and glia reuptake these neurotransmitters when they accumulate in the cleft
	-Na+-dependent transporters do the work
	-GABA is metabolized by enzyme GABA transaminase in the presynaptic cell or glial cell



OTHER (LESS COMMON) NEUROTRANSMITTERS
	...

ATP Neurotransmitter
	-often packaged in vesicles with other neurotransmitters
	-a cotransmitter with GABA, glutamate, ACh, dopamine, and peptides

Endocannabinoids
	-small lipid neurotransmitters
	-retrograde messengers bc they send messages from the postsynaptic to presynaptic cell
	-their synthesis is caused by elevated Ca2+ levels in the cell
	-not packaged in vesicles
	-diffuse across the membrane and bind selectively to CB1 type cannabinoid receptors
	-the receptors reduce the opening of presynaptic Ca2+ channels and prevents release of neurotransmitters in a highly active neuron

Nitric Oxide
	-gaseous
	-synthesized from aa arginine
	-regulates blood flow
	-diffuses across membranes



TRANSMITTER GATED CHANNELS
	...

1. Glutamate-Gated Channels
	includes 3 receptor subtypes: AMPA, NMDA, and kainate

AMPA-Gated Channels
	-permeable to Na+ and K+
	-not permeable to Ca2+
	-when activated, they allow more Na+ to enter than K+ leaves for a net increase in cations within the cell
	-causes rapid depolarization, mediating excitatory transmission in the CNS
	-often coexist with NMDA receptors at many brain synapses

NMDA-Gated Channels
	-causes excitatory responses
	-allow Na+ and Ca2+ to enter the cell while K+ leaves, but it's voltage dependent
	-when glutamate binds, the pore opens
	-however, if the membrane is at resting potential then the channel gets clogged with Mg2+
	-Mg2+ leaves the pore only when the membrane is depolarized

2. GABA-Gated Channels
	-GABA mediates most synaptic inhibition in the CNS
	-channel allows passage of Cl-
	-the drug classes benzodiazepines and barbiturates have their own binding sites on the channel
	-when they bind at the same time as GABA, it increases the frequency of Cl- channel-openings, leading to stronger IPSPs
	-ethanol also increases the IPSPs when it binds at the same time as GABA
	-each drug can bind only to channels with certain subunits
	-these drugs are not naturally going to bind to the channel (they are modern drugs that humans use), so scientists have to find the real reason for those binding sites

3. Glycine-Gated Channels
	-Glycine mediates any other synaptic inhibition that GABA does not
	-channel allows passage of Cl-



G-PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTORS
	...

G-Protein Receptor Structure
	-single polypeptide containing 7 alpha helices
	-2 extracellular loops for the transmitter binding sites
	-structural variations in these sites determines which neurotransmitters, agonists, or antagonists can bind
	-2 intracellular loops bind to G-proteins and structural variations there determine which proteins they activate

G-protein
	-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein
	-consists of 3 subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma



G-PROTEIN ACTIVATION STEPS
	...

Step 1
	GDP is bound to the alpha subunit

Step 2
	when the protein bumps into an activated receptor, its GDP is exchanged for GTP

Step 3
	-the protein splits into 2 parts: alpha subunit + GTP and the beta-gamma complex
	-both parts can continue on to activate or inactivate effector proteins

Step 4
	the alpha subunit is an enzyme that breaks down GTP into GDP

Step 5
	the alpha subunit and beta-gamme complex come back together

Shortcut Pathway
	-when a subunit of the G-protein immediately activates an ion channel (the effector)
	-fastest pathway involving a G-protein
	-still slower than transmitter-gated channels

Second Messenger Cascades
	-when the G-protein activates other enzymes, leading to a series of biochemical reactions
	-even though this provides a complex and slow transmission, it allows for signal amplification (many ion channels can be activated)
	-also allows signaling to occur over a distance
	-generate long-lasting chemical changes in cells

Divergence
	-the ability of one transmitter type to activate more than one subtype of receptor and cause more than one type of postsynaptic response
	-one transmitter can affect different neurons or different parts of the same neuron in different ways

Convergence
	-multiple transmitters can each activate their own receptor type
	-but, they can converge to influence the same effector system

	-dorsal root contains axons bringing info into the spinal cord
	-ventral root contains axons bringing info out of the spinal cord



PARTS OF PNS
	...

Somatic PNS
	-all nerves that innervate the skin, joints, and muscles that are under voluntary control
	-while the cell bodies of some of these nerves (notably the motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord) are in the CNS, their axons fall in the PNS

Dorsal Root Ganglia
	-somatic sensory axons collect info from the skin, joints, and muscles
	-they enter the spinal cord through the dorsal roots

	-in the subarachnoid space, CSF is absorbed by blood vessels

Hydrocephalus
	"water on the brain"
	-caused by impaired flow of CSF through the ventricular system
	-leads to swelling of the ventricles (cavities)
	-babies can be born with this condition, but the skull can expand in response the the fluid and prevent damage
	-in adults, the skull cannot expand and brain tissue is compressed
	-impairs brain function and eventually leads to death



BRAIN IMAGING
	...

CLARITY Method
	-allows us to see the brain in 3D without slicing it
	-the brain is soaked in a solution that replaces light-absorbing lipids with water-soluble gel

Computed Tomography (CT Scan)
	-first noninvasive way of imaging the grey and white matter + position of ventricles in a living brain
	-involves an X-ray beam

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
	-gives a more detailed map of the brain than a CT scan
	-does not require X-irradiation
	-a radio signal passes through the head to add energy to hydrogen atoms (2 poles of a magnet on either side)
	-the protons will jump from low energy state to high energy state at the right frequency
	-when the radio signal is off, the hydrogen atoms fall to the low energy state and emit the radio signal of the same frequency
	-a radio receiver picks up this signal

Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
	-an application of MRI
	-provides images of large bundles of axons in the brain
	-looks at the position of hydrogen atoms in water molecules at different time intervals
	-in this way, it measures diffusion of water in the brain

Positron Emission Tomography (PET Scan)
	-a way to see changes in regional blood flow and metabolism in the brain
	-a radioactive solution containing atoms that emit positrons is introduced to the bloodstream
	-the positrons interact with electrons to produce photons of electromagnetic radiation

	-at this stage, the brain is only a flat layer of cells

Neural Tube
	-the neural groove forms in the neural plate, and the sides begin to fold into each other dorsally
	-the walls form the entire CNS
	-the failure of this tube to close correctly can be due to folic acid deficiency during pregnancy
	-3 vesicles form at the rostral end of the tube, and this eventually becomes the brain

Neural Crest
	-when the folds of the neural tube come together, some ectoderm is pinched off
	-this tissue lies lateral to the neural tube

	-people usually have 2000-5000 buds

Tastebud Threshold
	-the critical concentrations at which the stimulus will evoke a perception of taste
	-above the threshold most papillae are sensitive to one type of taste
	-if concentrations of the same stimuli increase, the papillae will become less sensitive

Taste Receptor Cell
	-the apical end is the region of membrane that is chemically sensitive
	-the apical ends have microvilli that extend into the taste pore, an opening exposing the taste cell to the tongue surface

	-most respond exclusively to one specific taste

Basal Cells
	-the taste cells also make electrical and chemical synapses onto the basal cells
	-the basal cells then synapse onto sensory axons

Receptor Potential
	-when a chemical activates a taste receptor cell the membrane potential depolarizes
	-if the depolarization is large enough, some taste receptor cells will fire actions potentials

Step 1
	when Na+ (the saltiness is largely due to Na+, not the anion it is associated with in the salt) is introduced in small concentrations, the gradient of Na+ across the receptor cell membrane increases

Step 2
	Na+ diffuses down its concentration gradient and into the cell, causing the membrane to depolarize

Step 3
	the depolarization causes voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels to open near synaptic vesicles, triggering the release of neurotransmitter

	gustatory axon --> brain stem -->medulla--> thalamus --> cerebral cortex



SOURNESS TRANSDUCTION

Step 3
	IP3 opens an ion channel and allows Na+ to enter, leading to depolarization of the taste cell

Step 4
	IP3 also triggers the release of Ca2+, which activates a membrane channel that allows ATP to flow out of the cell (there are no vesicles containing the neurotransmitter in these cells)

Step 5
	-ATP acts a synaptic transmitter and activates receptors on afferent gustatory axons related to bitterness
	
	gustatory axon --> brain stem -->medulla--> thalamus --> cerebral cortex

Refraction
	-the bending of light rats that can occur when they travel from one transparent medium to the other
	-ex: when you put your leg in a pool and it looks bent at the surface
	-this is because the light is traveling from air to water and it passes through the air faster
	-a greater angle of refraction will occur if there's a greater difference between the media
	-ex: in the eye, there is transparent media that cause light rays to bend to form images on the retina



STRUCTURE OF THE EYE
	...

Pupil
	-opening that allows light to enter the eye and reach the retina
	-it is dark so that it absorbs light

Iris
	-its pigmentation is what gives us our eye color
	-contains 2 muscles, one that makes the pupil smaller when it contracts and one that makes it larger

Cornea
	a glassy transparent external surface that covers the iris and pupil

Sclera
	"the white of the eye"
	-continuous with the cornea
	-the tough wall of the eyeball

Extraocular Muscles
	-3 pairs of muscles in the sclera
	-move the eyeball in its socket

Conjunctiva
	-a membrane that folds back from the inside of the eyelids and attaches to the sclera
	-lies in front of the extraocular muscles

Optic Nerves
	a bundle of the axons of the retinal neurons

Retina
	-found at the back of the eye
	-contains photoreceptors that convert light energy into neural activity
	-there are 2 overlapping retinas, one for low light levels and one for higher light levels

Optic Disk
	-where the optic nerves exit the retina
	-only part of the retina that does not contain photoreceptors
	-we are not aware of this "hole" in our vision bc the brain fills our perception of this area

Macula
	-a dark region in the middle of each retina
	-responsible for central vision

Fovea
	-another dark spot that marks the center of the retina
	-the thinnest part of the retina
	-it's a dip in the retina so that it passes the top layers of the retina and hits the photoreceptors directly

Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)
	-located in the thalamus
	-it's the first target of the optic nerves
	-from here, visual information goes to the cerebral cortex

Aqueous Humor
	the fluid behind the cornea that nourishes it

Lens
	a transparent lens lies behind the cornea and the aqueous humor

Ciliary Muscle
	-a muscle that forms a ring inside the eye going around the lens
	-the lens is attached to ligaments that are attached to this muscle

Vitreous Humor
	-the liquid that lies between the lens and retina
	-keeps the eyeball spherical



EYE DISORDERS
	...

Cataracts
	-affects many people over 65
	-involves the clouding of the lens
	-the old lens needs to be replaced with a plastic lens that cannot contract on its own

Glaucoma
	-progressive loss of vision due to elevated intraocular pressure
	-this is the leading cause of blindness
	-if the pressure in the aqueous humor gets too hight, the entire eye is stressed
	-this eventually damages the spot where the optic nerve leaves the eye

Detached Retina
	-when the retina pulls away from the wall of the eye
	-caused by a blow to the head or shrinkage of vitreous humor

Retinitis Pigmentosa
	-progressive degradation of photoreceptors
	-could result in total blindness
	-experience "tunnel vision"

Macular Degeneration
	-causes the loss of central vision
	-common in people over 65



RETINA STRUCTURE
	...

Flow of Visual Information in Retina
	Photoreceptors --> bipolar cells --> ganglion cells

Photoreceptors
	-the only light-sensitive cells in the retina
	-each contain an outer segment, inner segment, cell body, and synaptic terminal
	-2 types: rods and cones

Outer Segment of Photoreceptor
	-contains a stack of membranous disks
	-photopigments in the disks absorb light and trigger changes in the membrane potential

Rod Photoreceptors
	-have long, cylindrical outer segment
	-1000 times more sensitive to light than cones
	-more rods than cones in retina
	-responsible for seeing in the dark
	-no rods in the fovea

Cone Photoreceptors
	-have shorter outer segment with fewer disks
	-less sensitive to light than rods
	-responsible for seeing in the light and seeing color
	-3 different types of cones that each contain a different photopigments (sensitive to different wavelengths of light)
	-only cones in the fovea

Bipolar Cells
	-receive input from photoreceptors
	-affect the membrane potential of ganglion cells

Ganglion Cells
	-fire action potentials in response to light
	-impulses propagate along the optic nerve
	-only cells in retina that fire action potentials

Horizontal Cells
	-receive input from photoreceptors
	-project neurites laterally to influence nearby bipolar cells and photoreceptors

Amacrine Cells
	-receive input from bipolar cells
	-project laterally to influence nearby ganglion, bipolar, and amacrine cells

Retina Laminar Organization
	-the cells of the retina are organized in layers
	-the photoreceptors are the "bottom" layer, which means the light must pass through all of the other cell types before reaching the photoreceptors
	-the other cells are transparent so they light can pass
	-this arrangement is because the pigmented epithelium that lies below the photoreceptors helps maintain the cells and absorbs any extra light to prevent blurry images



ORDER OF LAYERS IN RETINA
	...

Layer 1
	ganglion cell layer

Layer 2
	inner plexiform layer
	(contains synaptic connections between bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells)

Layer 3
	Inner nuclear layer
	(contains bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells)

Layer 4
	outer plexiform layer
	(contains synaptic connections between bipolar and horizontal cells)

Layer 5
	Outer nuclear layer
	(contains photoreceptors)

Layer 6
	layer of photoreceptor outer segments
	(contains the light-sensitive part of the retina)



PHOTOTRANSDUCTION IN RODS
	...

Step 1
	light strikes the cornea perpendicularly and at other slightly different angles (because the surface is curved)

Step 2
	-the perpendicular light rays pass through the eyeball fluids straight to the retina
	-light rays hitting the cornea from other angles bend so that they converge at the retina
	(look at the top image)

Step 3
	light passes through the layers of retina until it reaches the rods at the back

Step 4
	in complete darkness, the the membrane potential of the rod is -30mV caused b influx of Na+ (called the dark current)

Step 5
	-the pigment rhodopsin absorbs light (receptor protein = opsin)
	-the light causes a conformational change in retinal so that it activates opsin

Step 6
	rhodopsin has changed so that it absorbs different wavelengths and that activates G-protein called Transducin

Step 7
	Transducin activates the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE) which breaks down cGMP

Step 8
	-since cGMP keeps Na+ channels open, its destruction leads to the closing of Na+ channels
	-the membrane hyperpolarizes

Step 9
	the rod releases neurotransmitter glutamate to activate bipolar cells, which activate ganglion cells



PHOTOTRANSDUCTION IN CONES
	...

Step 1
	light strikes the cornea perpendicularly and at other slightly different angles (because the surface is curved)

Step 2
	-the perpendicular light rays pass through the eyeball fluids straight to the retina
	-light rays hitting the cornea from other angles bend so that they converge at the retina
	(look at the top image)

Step 3
	light passes through the layers of retina until it reaches the cones at the back

Step 4
	in complete darkness, the the membrane potential of the cone is -30mV caused b influx of Na+ (called the dark current)

Step 5
	-the pigment rhodopsin absorbs light (receptor protein = opsin)
	-the light causes a conformational change in retinal so that it activates opsin
	-in cones, there are 3 types of opsin that absorb different wavelengths of light so that we can see a range of colors

Step 6
	rhodopsin has changed so that it absorbs different wavelengths and that activates G-protein called Transducin

Step 7
	Transducin activates the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE) which breaks down cGMP

Step 8
	-since cGMP keeps Na+ channels open, its destruction leads to the closing of Na+ channels
	-the membrane hyperpolarizes

Step 9
	the cone releases neurotransmitter glutamate to activate bipolar cells, which activate ganglion cells

Types of Cone Opsins
	blue - absorb 430 nm
	green - absorb 530 nm
	red - absorb 560 nm

Young-Helmholtz Trichromacy Theory
	our perception of colors is dependent on a mixture of colors and their ratios, not just one wavelength per color

Light Adaptation
	-when you step into light, the cones get hyperpolarized
	-this causes Na+ channels to close
	-but then the channels slowly begin to open again because Ca2+ (which inhibits the production of cGMP to keep Na+ channels open), cannot enter the cell
	-this means that cGMP won't be inhibited, more will be produced, and the Na+ channels can start to open again

Receptive Field
	-the area of the retina that would affect a particular neuron if light is shown on it
	-in other words, light hitting outside of the receptive field of a neuron won't affect that neuron

Antagonistic Center-Surround Receptive Fields
	-bipolar and ganglion cells have this
	-when the response of the cell's membrane potential to light in the receptive field is opposite to that of light in the surround

ON-Center Bipolar Cells
	-when light shown onto the receptive field causes the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor and depolarization of the bipolar cell
	-even though the cone is hyperpolarized to light, the ON bipolar cell has the opposite response
	-when light is shown in the surround of the receptive field causes hyperpolarization of the surrounding photoreceptors, depolarization of the central photoreceptor, hyperpolarization of horizontal cells, and the hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell
	receptors, which cause an inhibitory response

OFF-Center Bipolar Cells
	-when light shown onto the receptive field causes the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor and hyperpolarization of a bipolar cell
	-when light shown in the surround of the receptive field causes the surrounding photoreceptors to hyperpolarize, the central photoreceptor to depolarize, the horizontal cells to hyperpolarize, and the bipolar cell to depolarize

ON-Center Ganglion Cell
	-will be depolarized in response to light on its receptive field
	-initiates APs

OFF-Center Ganglion Cell
	-will fire few APs when light shines on its receptive field
	-if the receptive field is dark, it will fire more APs

Ganglion Cell Receptive Fields
	-in ganglion cells, the receptive field works slightly differently
	-with these cells, a light-dark edge of light will produce the greatest activity in the cell
	-therefore, when the center and surround are completely lit up or completely dark, there will be very little response because the center and surround responses are opposite and cancel each other out
	-depending on if the ganglion cell is OFF or ON type, it will have more or less firing of APs when the light covers the center completely (and only a bit of surround), or when the light covers the surround (and a little bit of the center)

M-Type Ganglion Cells
	-large receptive fields
	-conduct APs more rapidly in optic nerve
	-most sensitive to low-contrast stimuli
	-repsond to stimulation of receptive field centers with bursts of APs

P-Type Ganglion Cells
	-small receptive field s
	-conduct APs slowly
	-not sensitive to low-contrast stimuli
	-respond to stimulation of receptive field centers with a sustained discharge of APs while the stimulus is on

Color-Opponent Cells
	-P and nonP-nonM ganglion cells that are sensitive to colors
	-M ganglion cells don't differentiate between the colors, so it won't matter which color illuminates which part of the receptive field, they have the same response to everything
	-when one color shows in the center and one in the surround, it cancels the response
	-the types of opponency are red vs. green and blue vs. yellow

Red-Green Color Opponency
	ex: red ON center green OFF surround (R+G-)
	-there is some overlap in the wavelengths that red and green cones will absorb
	-if red light is only in the center, there will be a strong burst of APs
	-if red light is in the center and surround, there will be fewer APs because the green cones in the surround will also absorb some of the red-light wavelengths and initiate the inhibitory response
	-if red is in the center and green is in the surround, the excitatory response is canceled
	-white light would equally activate both center and surround, canceling the response

Blue-Yellow Color Opponency
	ex: blue ON center yellow OFF surround (B+Y-)
	-the yellow wavelengths with be absorbed by both red and green cones
	-there is LITTLE overlap in the wavelengths that blue cones will absorb vs. red and green cones
	-if blue light is only in the center, there will be a strong burst of APs
	-if blue light is in the center and surround, there will still be a strong response because the red and green cones in the surround do not absorb the same wavelengths of light
	-if blue is in the center and yellow is in the surround, the excitatory response is canceled
	-white light would equally activate both center and surround, canceling the response

Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs)
	-some ganglion cells can transduce light like photoreceptors (although, not many)
	-use melanopsin as a photopigment
	-they depolarize to light and have very large receptive fields
	-this means that they aren't good for seeing fine patterns, but are instead used for detecting changes in sunlight and synchronizing behavior to the circadian rhythm
	-they also receive input from rods and cones and send APs through the optic nerve, like normal ganglion cells

Focal Distance
	distance between the surface of the cornea where the light hits and the point at which the light rays converge at the retina

Diopter
	-a unit of measurement for refractive power of the cornea
	-the reciprocal of focal distance

Lens Accomodation
	-the lens must change its shape depending on how far away an object is
	-objects that are father away, little refraction is needed so the lens is flat due to ciliary muscle relaxation
	-closer objects require more refraction so the lens bends by ciliary muscle contraction

Pupillary Light Reflex
	-when the pupil gets larger when it's dark and smaller when it's light
	-constriction in response to light gives the eye a greater depth of focus (meaning more things will be in focus at a range of distances)

Visual Field
	the area that each eye can see

Visual Acuity
	the ability of the eye to distinguish 2 points near each other



PROBLEMS WITH VISION
	...

Emmetropia
	-normal eyesight
	-when no accomodation is needed to see objects over a wide range of distances

Hyperopia
	"farsightedness"
	-when the eyeball is too short from the back
	-the light will focus on a point behind the retina

Myopia
	"nearsightedness"
	-when the eyeball is too long from the back
	-the light will converge at a point before the retina

Astigmatism
	when curvature and refraction of the light is different

Presbyopia
	-the hardening of the lens with aging
	-the lens is less elastic and is unable to change shape and accommodate to focus on both near and far objects

Parallel Processing
	-different visual attributes are processed simultaneously using distinct pathways
	-ex: we use 2 eyes to see, and they produce parallel streams of info
	-this helps us determine the depth of the image
